# Intentions

Why am I studying acoustics?

1. To make music
2. To build on my studies of optics
3. To practice scientific coding
4. To practice documentation

## Making music

A web of interests and inspirations coalesce my desire to make music of my own.

In general, my creative practice is a practice of self-awareness, vulnerability, and self-expression. What do I think? How do I feel? And how can I meaningfully convey this to 'others' - from people I love to people I will never know. Music is a beautiful and rich mode of self-expression, and I want to explore it.

My creative practice is also a simpler commitment to study, experimentation, and process. Like so many other arts, music making lives at an intersection between science, heart, presence, and patience, among other things. I guess this is a way of saying that to make music is to commune with nature intellectually, emotionally, and physically. 

Growing up, I dabbled with a variety of instruments, following a variety of musical traditions. Now, having recently gained new skills in optics, physics, and computer science, I feel empowered to use modern tools to my own ends. I feel called to use these new skills to make music that is deeply personal and not so circumscribed by tradition. 

Another element of my inspiration has to do with "life writing" and documentation. I want to record audio from my life, edit it, and collage it alongside synthesized and analog tracks to tell stories about how I feel; who I am; and what I dream. This is an act of self love and reverence for the richness of experience. It is also an experiment in communication. How can I share my experience and perspective with you? Language is a beautiful and powerful technology of communciation, but it is ideologically fraught and susceptible to misunderstanding. Music speaks differently.

## Studying 

I love math, and I love physics. They are beautiful languages for describing what we observe around us. And mathematical, physical descriptions of sound form the foundations of digital music making. 

Having just completed my MS in optical sciences, I am hungry to continue exercising and growing my knack for mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena. Acoustics is a sensible field to explore next, given its overlap with my desire to make some music! 

## Coding

My studies and work in optical sciences introduced me to the worlds of computer science and coding. It is satisfying and beautiful to learn theoretical descriptions of physics; it is empowering to discover how theoretical descriptions can be "digitized" and wielded by modern computers to create art and technology. To me, physics and computer science are an inseparable pair. I love to observe and analyze the world around me, but I am obsessed and fascinated with the process of using the results of that observation and analysis to create something new.

## Documentation

You may recall that one of my motivations to make music is a desire to document my life and experience and to share those 'documents' with others. On a similar note, I want to document and share my learning process. There are a few reasons for that, I think.

To start, I need to acknowledge that I'm not a trained artist by any right. I don't make art to create some [beautiful, provocative, cool, transgressive, stylish, etc.] object to behold. If I wanted to make that kind of art, I would not know how. 

I make art because I feel lonely in my heart and mind, because I am desperate to figure out how to convey my heart to the world, because my heart is broken for the world and for myself living in it, because I am hopeful and because I see beauty all around me, because I still don't know how to fix anything but I am not done trying to anyways. 

Learning is how I live in this world. It's the utility knife of my "life" toolkit - I use it for everything. I learn about my body; about my needs and desires and dreams; about how to cook and bake; about how to garden; about love; about my family; about communication, friendship, relationships; about politics, history, psychology; about nature; about art. You get the picture. 

To me, learning is a sacred and complicated process. It requires humility, patience, openmindedness, grace, and courage. It is an art in and of itself, and it is one of the things that I care the most to document. 

Documenting my studies of acoustics, my coding projects, and my creative process is as important as the studies, the coding, and process itself. It provides a rich foundation of democratizing lore for anyone who may come across my work. Wonder why I did something? How I did it? How I learned to do it? Read away - the docs are all here. In this way, my process becomes a potentially empowering resource for others to pursue projects and explorations of their own.
