# Acoustics README.md

This repository houses my Acoustics studies. It is a partner to my `SuperCollider` project.

## Getting Started

I am starting from scratch, beginning with Kinsler et al.'s 'Fundamentals of Acoustics' (2000) - an introductory graduate-level acoustics text.

I will work through each chapter of the text by this process:

1. I will read the chapter and take hand-written notes.
2. I will review the chapter, alongside my notes, drafting summaries in this repository.
3. I will formulate a series of questions that can be answered by the chapter's contents.
4. I will write Rust code that implements core equations to answer these questions. 
5. I will test the Rust code on the chapter's homework problems to probe for underdeveloped areas or unaccounted-for edge cases.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes a few key sections:

1. `texts/` houses source texts
2. `notes/` houses summative notes, organized by text and by chapter
3. `simulator/` houses my Rust simulator, including documentation of its own

## Notes on Style

I will strive to make the contents of this repository clear and well-organized, because this is how I like to think and to document my thinking. But at the end of the day, the repository is for me, and so I will write in whatever way helps me understand the ideas, equations, and models that I come across!
